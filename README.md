# DevSecOps
DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It's an approach that integrates security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle. 

1- Integration of Security: Unlike traditional methods where security is added at the end, DevSecOps incorporates security from the very beginning of the development process.

2- Collaboration: It encourages collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to ensure that security is a shared responsibility.

3- Automation: DevSecOps relies heavily on automation to integrate and test security measures continuously, making it easier to identify and fix vulnerabilities early.

4- Efficiency and Speed: By addressing security issues early and continuously, DevSecOps helps in delivering secure software faster and more efficiently.

5- Proactive Security: It involves continuous monitoring, auditing, and testing for security issues throughout the development cycle.
